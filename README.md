- 👋 Hi, I’m James Edebo
- 👀 I’m interested in software development. Have been in the geospatial industry for 5 years now.
- 🌱 I started as a G.I.S Analyst, while practicing and developing some programming skills.
- I'm currently focusing on web application developement, in order to bridge the gap of not having a software development background, I’m currently enrolled in the 12 months software developement program from Microverse.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on web mapping application projects
- 📫 You can rerach me in different ways, but a visit to my portfolio site comes a bit more handy and will reveal more about me. (www.debbyjimmy.com)
